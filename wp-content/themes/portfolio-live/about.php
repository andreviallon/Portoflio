So, this is where I get to talk a bit about myself. My name is Andre. I am hybrid UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer with a thrilling passion for creating modern and beautiful solutions to make my user’s life easier.

I’ve always been interested in challenging myself. That’s why I left France, my home country, when I was 17 for new adventures and moved to Denmark where I joined the International Baccalaureate. This is where I started to develop a strong interest in storytelling as well as human behavior by studying English Literature as well as Anthropology.

This combined with my curiosity for new technologies led me to become a UX Designer. Therefore, I’ve been studying Web Development and UI/UX Design for the past 3 years at the International Business Academy in Kolding, Denmark.
