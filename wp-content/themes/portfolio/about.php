                    So, this is where I get to talk a bit about myself. My name is Andre. I am hybrid Frontend Developer and UX Designer with a thrilling passion for creating modern and innovative solutions.
<br/><br/>
I've always been interested in challenging myself. That's why I left France, my home country, when I was 17 for new adventures and moved to Denmark where I joined the International Baccalaureate. This is where I started to develop a strong interest in storytelling as well as human behavior by studying English Literature as well as Anthropology that helped me on the path of becoming a UX Designer.
<br/><br/>
This combined with my curiosity for new technologies led me to become a Frontend Developer. Therefore, I've been studying Web Development for the past 3 years at the International Business Academy in Kolding, Denmark.
<br/><br/>
I am currently looking for an internship to grow my skills in Frontend and/or UX/UI Design.
